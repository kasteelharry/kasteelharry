# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Joris Kuiper and I am a Technical Computer Science student at the University of Twente and aspiring software engineer.

Over the years I have experimented with a few different programming languages in various projects. These projects have ranged from a PoS system to websites and servers. Most of them are public. However due to the academic nature of some projects, I had to keep those private unfortunately.
